        <p>
            City Circuits is a visualization tool to help study and interpret open source language models, such as <a href='https://github.com/openai/gpt-2'>GPT-2</a>.
            City Circuits combines several interpretability methods,
            such as <a href='https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/'>saliency maps</a>,
            the <a href='https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens'>logit lens</a>,
            and <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08696'>knowledge neurons</a> in
            an interactive fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the size and diversity of modern datasets for language models,
            this project is (for now) narrowly focused on how GPT-2 stores knowledge about specific topics like
            the cities of the world.

            Unsure where to begin?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Here are some interesting neurons to start with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a href={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/viewer?neuron=21,775`}>(21, 775)</a> -
                    this neuron activates most strongly when the words "city" and "capital"
                    and followed by "of", indicating this neuron plays a role in signaling to future layers
                    that the captial of a city needs to be predicted.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a href={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/viewer?neuron=46,438`}>(46, 438)</a>
                    {' & '}
                    <a href={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/viewer?neuron=46,5959`}>(46, 5959)</a> -
                    these neurons spike immediately after seeing the tokens "an" and pretty much nothing else,
                    which seems strange since they are both close to the last layer of the model.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a href={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/viewer?neuron=47,4365`}>(47, 4365)</a>
                    similar to (46, 438) and (46, 5959), except it responds to "a" instead.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a href={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/viewer?neuron=32,1809`}>(46, 438)</a> -
                    this neuron responds to certain articles and common/short verbs, such as "of", "is", and "in."
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>;
